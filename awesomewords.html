            <h2>These are words I think are really cool for varying reasons</h2>
            <p>Most of these words do not come up often in everyday conversation and I find many to be goofy. I have different reasons for liking these words but most of the time its because they are so unique and uncommon to see. I cannot list all of the words I find awesome because there are too many, hopefully you enjoy this abbreviated list.</p>
